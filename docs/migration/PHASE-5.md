# TanStack Start Migration — Phase 5 (Testing & Validation)

Status: Completed for current scope.

- All existing tests pass (`bun run test` → 31/31).
- Start app routes validated at build-time. Dev proxy configured for `/rpc`, `/api/auth`, `/api/chat`, and `/api/openrouter/models`.
- Server now hosts the migrated endpoints:
  - `POST /api/chat` (streaming)
  - `POST /api/chat/send`
  - `POST /api/openrouter/models`

Pending (follow-up tasks):
- Add route-level tests for Start routes and guard redirects.
- Perf/lighthouse & cross-browser pass to confirm parity.
