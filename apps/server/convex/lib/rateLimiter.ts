 * - User authentication: 100/min (high limit for auth flows)
 * - API key save: 5/min (rarely changed)
 * - API key remove: 5/min (rarely changed)
 *
 * CHAT OPERATIONS:
 * - Chat creation: 20/min with 5 burst
 * - Chat deletion: 15/min with 3 burst
 *
 * MESSAGE OPERATIONS:
 * - Message send: 30/min with 10 burst
 * - Stream upsert: 200/min with 50 burst (AI streaming needs high throughput)
 *
 * FILE OPERATIONS:
 * - Upload URL generation: 10/min with 3 burst
 * - File metadata save: 10/min with 3 burst
 * - File deletion: 15/min with 5 burst
