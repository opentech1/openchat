# Test Fixtures

Add test files here for E2E tests:

- test-image.png (small PNG image for upload tests)
- test-image.jpg (small JPEG image for upload tests)
- test-image.webp (small WebP image for upload tests)

You can create simple test images using any image editor or download placeholder images.

Example sizes:
- Keep files small (< 100KB) for faster test execution
- Use simple colored squares or patterns
- Recommended dimensions: 100x100 to 500x500 pixels
